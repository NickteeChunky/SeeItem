# SeeItem
See any player's [item]ed item using /seeitem.

How to Use:

1. Hold the item you want to [item] in your hand.
2. Type "[item]" in chat and it'll replace [item] with a detailed format (Soon Customizable)
3. For you and other players to see your item including it's lore, they can do /seeitem which will open up a UI.
4. This UI will list every player's [item]ed item. From there, you can click on the player whose item you want to see and it'll open up a small hopper menu pointing to the player's item.
